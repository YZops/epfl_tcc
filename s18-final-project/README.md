# MY FINAL PROJECT
A one or two sentence description of your project here.

- What does it do?  
  This is a "Money Saving App". All savings can be added in the app.
  For example: When you buy something at the supermarket, you can see how much you have saved at the checkout or on the receipt. This information can be added in the app.
  You can see how much money you have saved over a period of time.

- What is the "new feature" which you have implemented that we haven't seen before?  
  - Deleting entries from a database textfile with a more complex datastructure.
  - Working with Dates in Python and JavaScript.
  - More complex server-side checks of user input with regex -> Used Tool for testing: https://regex101.com/
  - More extensive use of the Flask framework with multi request handling and render_template and a better file structure. Thanks to this guy who explained Flask in more detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGKKnfLobA
  - General: More detailed success and error messages and better user experience.
